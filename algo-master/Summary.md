# Exercises Not Solved
- arrays - First Missing Positive in O(n) - the intuition was correct - I just was not able to complete the solution within reasonable time
- strings - Guess the Word - I sorted the words related to their similarity, but it was not enough. I needed to cluster them instead.
- bit manipulation - single number (in O(1) space and O(n) time)
- bit manipulation - number of 1 bits
- bit manipulation - reverse bits - the solution was ok (even if not optimal), but I was using pow that was causing errors on even numbers. Changing it to shift left, solved the issue.


# Exercises Solved But Not In The Best Way
- arrays - majority element (found a solution better than brute force but not the optimal one)
- arrays - move zeroes (solved with brute force)
- arrays - remove duplicates from sorted array (solved with brute force)
- arrays - max profit (solved with brute force)
- arrays - rotate array (solved with a support linked list)
- arrays - max profit II (solved with heavy suggestions by ChatGPT)
- strings - is palindrome (the solution is good, I forgot the numeric case when reading the requirements. moreover, I am not super fluent in kotlin operators for strings)
- strings - longest common prefix (solved vertically. I did not even think about binary search)
- strings - Zig Zag conversion (solved in the proper way. The only thing I did not use the string builder but I created new string at each iteration, which is a bit more costly that using a string builder).
- strings - Reverse words (if the string was mutable, I would not have thought about the multiple reverse in place that could be done to reduce space).
- bit manipulation - Counting Bits (solved with brute force).

# Exercises Solved Perfectly
- arrays - number of zero filled subArrays
- arrays - increasing triplet
- strings - is subsequence
