# Exercises Not Solved
- arrays - First Missing Positive in O(n) - the intuition was correct - I just was not able to complete the solution within reasonable time


# Exercises Solved But Not In The Best Way
- arrays - majority element (found a solution better than brute force but not the optimal one)
- arrays - move zeroes (solved with brute force)
- arrays - remove duplicates from sorted array (solved with brute force)
- arrays - max profit (solved with brute force)
- arrays - rotate array (solved with a support linked list)
- arrays - max profit II (solved with heavy suggestions by ChatGPT)
- string - isPalindrome (the solution is good, I forgot the numeric case when reading the requirements. moreover, I am not super fluent in kotlin operators for strings)

# Exercises Solved Perfectly
- arrays - number of zero filled subArrays
- arrays - increasing triplet
- string - isSubsequence
