# Exercise list
1. Range Sum Query - Immutable
2. Subarray Sum Equals K
3. Subarray Sums Divisible by K
4. Continuous Subarray Sum
5. Contiguous Array

## Attempt 1
* Range Sum Query - Immutable (SOLVED_PERFECTLY -> probably because I was the algorithm few minutes before)
* Subarray Sum Equals K  (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL)
* Subarray Sums Divisible by K (NOT_SOLVED)
* Continuous Subarray Sum (NOT_SOLVED -> could have solved brute force but I knew it was not the proper solution)
* Contiguous Array (NOT_SOLVED -> could have solved brute force but I knew it was not the proper solution)

## Attempt 2
* Range Sum Query - Immutable (SOLVED_ALMOST_PERFECTLY -> I did not remember perfectly the algorithm)
* Subarray Sum Equals K (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL)
* Subarray Sums Divisible by K (NOT_SOLVED)

* Contiguous Array (NOT_SOLVED)

## Attempt 3
* Range Sum Query - Immutable (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Subarray Sum Equals K (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Subarray Sums Divisible by K (NOT_SOLVED -> forgot negative remainder)
* Continuous Subarray Sum (NOT_SOLVED -> wrong math assumption)
* Contiguous Array (NOT_SOLVED -> did not remember the trick)
