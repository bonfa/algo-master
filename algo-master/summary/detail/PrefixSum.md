## Attempt 1
* Range Sum Query - Immutable (SOLVED PERFECTLY -> probably because I was the algorithm few minutes before)
* Subarray Sum Equals K  (SOLVED SUB_OPTIMAL)
* Subarray Sums Divisible by K (NOT_SOLVED)
* Continuous Subarray Sum (NOT_SOLVED -> could have solved brute force but I knew it was not the proper solution)
* Contiguous Array (NOT_SOLVED -> could have solved brute force but I knew it was not the proper solution)

## Attempt 2
