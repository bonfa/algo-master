# Exercise list
1. Is subsequence
2. Valid palindrome
3. Longest Common Prefix
4. Zigzag conversion
5. Reverse words in a String
6. Guess the word


# Attempt 2
1. Is subsequence (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
2. Valid palindrome (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
3. Longest Common Prefix (solved vertically. I did not even think about binary search)
4. Zigzag conversion (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - worse than version 1)
5. Reverse words in a String (SOLVED_PERFECTLY - I skipped built in functions but this case that solution would have been the perfect one, and also with same complexity as other more complex solutions)
6. Guess the word

# Attempt 1
## Exercises Not Solved
- Guess the Word - I sorted the words related to their similarity, but it was not enough. I needed to cluster them instead.

## Exercises Solved But Not In The Best Way
- is palindrome (the solution is good, I forgot the numeric case when reading the requirements. moreover, I am not super fluent in kotlin operators for strings)
- longest common prefix (solved vertically. I did not even think about binary search)
- Zig Zag conversion (solved in the proper way. The only thing I did not use the string builder but I created new string at each iteration, which is a bit more costly that using a string builder).
- Reverse words (if the string was mutable, I would not have thought about the multiple reverse in place that could be done to reduce space).

## Exercises Solved Perfectly
- is subsequence
