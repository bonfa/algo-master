# Exercise list
1. Is subsequence
2. Valid palindrome
3. Longest Common Prefix
4. Zigzag conversion
5. Reverse words in a String
6. Guess the word

# Attempt 1
1. Is subsequence (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
2. Valid palindrome (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - the solution is good, I forgot the numeric case when reading the requirements. moreover, I am not super fluent in kotlin operators for strings)
3. Longest Common Prefix (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - solved vertically. I did not even think about binary search)
4. Zigzag conversion (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - solved in the proper way. The only thing I did not use the string builder but I created new string at each iteration, which is a bit more costly that using a string builder)
5. Reverse words in a String (SOLVED_PERFECTLY - I skipped built in functions but this case that solution would have been the perfect one, and also with same complexity as other more complex solutions)
6. Guess the word (NOT_SOLVED - I sorted the words related to their similarity, but it was not enough. I needed to cluster them instead)

# Attempt 2
1. Is subsequence (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
2. Valid palindrome (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
3. Longest Common Prefix (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - solved vertically. I did not even think about binary search)
4. Zigzag conversion (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - worse than version 1)
5. Reverse words in a String (SOLVED_PERFECTLY - I skipped built-in functions but this case that solution would have been the perfect one, and also with same complexity as other more complex solutions)
6. Guess the word (NOT_SOLVED - The solution I thought I understood as the optimal one actually was not the optimal one and failed on bad cases)

# Attempt 3
* Longest Common Prefix (NOT_SOLVED -> I knew the proper algorithm, but I failed the implementation)
* Zigzag conversion (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Guess the word (NOT_SOLVED -> the solution was not completely correct)

## Attempt 4
* Longest Common Prefix (NOT_SOLVED -> could not implement binary search properly in the amount of time)
* Guess the word (NOT_SOLVED -> did not remember the proper strategy)

## Attempt 5
* Longest Common Prefix (NOT_SOLVED -> could not implement binary search properly in the amount of time)
* Guess the word (NOT_SOLVED -> did not remember the proper strategy)
