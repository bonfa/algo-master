# Attempt 1
* Intersection of Two Linked Lists (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> did not get a super simple final optimization)
* Design Linked List (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Remove Nth Node From End of List (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> lost in edge cases)
* Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> the performance are comparable with the ideal solution but using a dummy node would improve a lot the clarity of the solution)
* Swap Nodes in Pairs (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Copy List with Random Pointer (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> did not use constant space)
* Partition List (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Rotate List (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Add Two Numbers (SOLVED_PERFECTLY -> took a bit to find the optimal solution but that's fine)
*  Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL)
