# Attempt 1
1. Intersection of Two Linked Lists (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> did not get a super simple final optimization)
2. Design Linked List (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
3. Remove Nth Node From End of List (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> lost in edge cases)
4. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> the performance are comparable with the ideal solution but using a dummy node would improve a lot the clarity of the solution)
