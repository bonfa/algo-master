# Exercise list
1. Maximum Average Subarray I
2. Find All Anagrams in a String
3. Permutation in String
4. Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K
5. Substring with Concatenation of All Words

# Attempt 1
* Maximum Average Subarray I (SOLVED_PERFECTLY -> I saw the algorithm 2 minutes before)
* Find All Anagrams in a String (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> Used map)
* Permutation in String (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL)
* Substring with Concatenation of All Words (NOT_SOLVED)

# Attempt 2
* Maximum Average Subarray I (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Find All Anagrams in a String (SOLVED_ALMOST_PERFECTLY -> did not initialize the two arrays in the same loop at the first iteration)
* Permutation in String (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K (SOLVED_ALMOST_PERFECTLY)
* Substring with Concatenation of All Words (NOT_SOLVED -> the solution was there but I finished the time in the edge cases)

## After Attempt 3
* Find All Anagrams in a String (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K (SOLVED_ALMOST_PERFECTLY)
* Substring with Concatenation of All Words (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> the solution was close to the optimal one, but I needed to optimise it further)

## Attempt 4
* Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL)
* Substring with Concatenation of All Words (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL)
