# Current solution
Skipping the solutions where I do not remember the optimal algorithm

## Exercises Solved But Not In The Best Way
- move zeroes (solved with 2 pointers, but added useless internal loop)

## Exercises Not Solved
- majority element

# Version 1
## Exercises Not Solved
- First Missing Positive in O(n) - the intuition was correct - I just was not able to complete the solution within reasonable time

## Exercises Solved But Not In The Best Way
- move zeroes (solved with brute force)
- majority element (found a solution better than brute force but not the optimal one)
- remove duplicates from sorted array (solved with brute force)
- max profit (solved with brute force)
- rotate array (solved with a support linked list)
- max profit II (solved with heavy suggestions by ChatGPT)

## Exercises Solved Perfectly
- number of zero filled subArrays
- increasing triplet
