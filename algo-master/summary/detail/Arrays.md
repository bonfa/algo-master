# Attempt 3
1. Move Zeroes (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL --> two pointers but with internal loop)
2. Majority Element (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
4. Rotate Array
5. Product of Array Except Self
6. First Missing Positive

# Attempt 2
Skipping the solutions where I do not remember the optimal algorithm

1. Move Zeroes (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL --> two pointers but with internal loop)
2. Majority Element (NOT_SOLVED)
3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (SOLVED_ALMOST_PERFECTLY --> took too much time)
4. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
5. Rotate Array (SOLVED_ALMOST_PERFECTLY --> took too much time)
6. Product of Array Except Self (SOLVED_ALMOST_PERFECTLY --> used the first hint of leetcode)
7. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
8. Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
9. Increasing Triplet Subsequence (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
10. First Missing Positive (SOLVED_ALMOST_PERFECTLY --> the solution is similar to the one of AlgoMaster, however it took me a bit more time tha 45m and the code is a bit messy)

# Attempt 1
1. Move Zeroes (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> used brute force)
2. Majority Element  (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> the solution was better than brute force)
3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> solved with brute force)
4. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> solved with brute force)
5. Rotate Array (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> solved with a support data structure)
6. Product of Array Except Self (NOT_SOLVED)
7. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (SOLVED_WITH_HELP -> solved with heavy suggestions by ChatGPT)
8. Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
9. Increasing Triplet Subsequence (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
10. First Missing Positive (NOT_SOLVED -> the intuition was correct - I just was not able to complete the solution within reasonable time)
