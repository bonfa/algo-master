## Attempt 1
1. Design HashMap (SKIPPED -> I found the solution ready in leetcode)
2. Maximum Number of Balloons (SOLVED_NOT_OPTIMAL -> Solved with map not with array)
3. Number of Good Pairs (SOLVED_OPTIMAL -> better than Hashish solution)
4. Isomorphic Strings (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> very similar to best solution, just used one map rather than two)
5. Ransom note (SOLVED_OPTIMAL)
6. Contains duplicate II (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> built a map and applied filter later, could have done it in place)
7. Group Anagrams (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> the idea was correct. I just used less efficient data structures)
8. Encode and Decode TinyURL  (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> I skipped the incremental value. I did not use base64 as encoding. I used a custom solution)
9. Reorganize String (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> used a map, not a priority queue)
