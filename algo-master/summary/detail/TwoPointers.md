4. 3Sum
5. Trapping Rain Water

# Attempt 1
* Merge sorted arrays (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> did not do in place substitution)
* Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Container With Most Water (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> tried with two pointers but wrong intuition, added brute force solution)
* 3Sum (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> brute force, tried two pointers but I was missing some cases)
* Trapping Rain Water (NOT_SOLVED)

# Attempt 2
* Merge sorted arrays (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> could not find the smart way to do the in place solution)
* Container With Most Water (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
