2. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
3. Container With Most Water
4. 3Sum
5. Trapping Rain Water

## Attempt 1
* Merge sorted arrays (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> did not do in place substitution)
* Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Container With Most Water (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> tried with two pointers but wrong intuition, added brute force solution)
* 3Sum (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> brute force, tried two pointers but I was missing some cases)
* Trapping Rain Water (NOT_SOLVED)

## Attempt 2
* Merge sorted arrays (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> could not find the smart way to do the in place solution)
* Container With Most Water (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* 3Sum (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL -> brute force - did not think about the proper trick)
* Trapping Rain Water (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL)

## Attempt 3
* Merge sorted arrays -> (NOT_SOLVED)
* 3Sum -> (NOT_SOLVED)
* Trapping Rain Water (NOT_SOLVED)

## Attempt 4
* Merge sorted arrays (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - forgot the trick for the in place solution)
* 3Sum (NOT_SOLVED)
* Trapping Rain Water (NOT_SOLVED)
