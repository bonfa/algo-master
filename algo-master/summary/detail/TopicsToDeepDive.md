# Topics To Deep Dive 
## Bit Manipulation
* Sum without + and - operations
* Multiplication using just shift and sum
* Division using subtractions and shifts
* Hamming weight (counting the number of bits set to 1)
* Find the least significant bit set to 1
* Inverting the bits
* Changing two numbers without a temporary variable
* Determine if a number is a power of 2 or not
* Bit rotation
* Great common divisor with Stein algorithm
