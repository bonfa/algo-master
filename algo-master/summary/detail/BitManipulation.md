# Current solution

# Exercises Not Solved
- bit manipulation - single number (in O(1) space and O(n) time)
- bit manipulation - number of 1 bits
- bit manipulation - reverse bits - the solution was ok (even if not optimal), but I was using pow that was causing errors on even numbers. Changing it to shift left, solved the issue.
- bit manipulation - sum of two integers without + and - (you need to know it)

# Exercises Solved But Not In The Best Way
- bit manipulation - Counting Bits (solved with brute force).
- bit manipulation - Bitwise AND of number range (I got close to the ideal solution but instead of shifting the actual numbers I calculated separately the highest bit set to 1, which is less efficient).
- bit manipulation - Single number III (solved easily with map. I still miss some knowledge related to bit manipulation)
