# Exercise list
1. Single Number
2. Number of 1 bits
3. Counting bits
4. Reverse bits
5. Bitwise AND of number range
6. Single number III
7. Sum of two integers

## After Attempt 4
* Counting bits (SOLVED PERFECTLY)
* Reverse bits (SOLVED PERFECTLY)
* Bitwise AND of number range (SOLVED PERFECTLY)
* Single number III
* Sum of two integers

## Attempt 3
* Counting bits (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - close to perfect but not yet the perfect one)
* Reverse bits (NOT_SOLVED)
* Bitwise AND of number range (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL)
* Single number III (NOT_SOLVED)
* Sum of two integers (NOT_SOLVED)

## Attempt 2
* Single Number (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Number of 1 bits (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Counting bits (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - calculated the number of 1 for each number)
* Reverse bits (SOLVED_OPTIMAL - small issue with shift)
* Bitwise AND of number range (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - brute force only plus quick exit for obvious zero cases)
* Single number III (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - with map - did not remember the optimal solution and why it worked)
* Sum of two integers (NOT_SOLVED - did not remember the solution)

## Attempt 1
* Single Number (NOT_SOLVED)
* Number of 1 bits (NOT_SOLVED)
* Counting bits (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - with brute force)
* Reverse bits (NOT_SOLVED - issues with pow)
* Bitwise AND of number range (NOT_SOLVED - intuition was corret)
* Single number III (SOLVED_SUB_OPTIMAL - with map)
* Sum of two integers (NOT_SOLVED)
