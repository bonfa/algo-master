# Current solution

## Iteration 2
* Single Number (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)
* Number of 1 bits (SOLVED_PERFECTLY)


# Exercises Not Solved
- single number (in O(1) space and O(n) time)
- number of 1 bits
- reverse bits - the solution was ok (even if not optimal), but I was using pow that was causing errors on even numbers. Changing it to shift left, solved the issue.
- sum of two integers without + and - (you need to know it)

# Exercises Solved But Not In The Best Way
- Counting Bits (solved with brute force).
- Bitwise AND of number range (I got close to the ideal solution but instead of shifting the actual numbers I calculated separately the highest bit set to 1, which is less efficient).
- Single number III (solved easily with map. I still miss some knowledge related to bit manipulation)
